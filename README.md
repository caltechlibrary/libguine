# Caltech Library customizations for LibGuides CMS

Within LibGuides CMS we can customize things like HTML headers and templates, CSS files, and jQuery/JavaScript code at the system, group, and guide level.

While we cannot directly use the code from this repository with LibGuides, we still want to track our changes here to have an official version of the customizations for our site. The code stored here must be copied and pasted into various places within LibGuides that are appropriate for the specific code snippets. This README file along with other inline comments will be the source for instructions on where to add code for our customizations.
